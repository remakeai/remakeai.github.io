    <p>Do you like pets? How about robotic pets? How about pet robots that are playful, big on character, intelligent, caring and useful?</p>

    <p>We are an early-stage high-tech startup developing a platform for home pet and companion robots for consumers as our warm-up product. Whether you are a software developer, a DIY enthusiast or a prospective customer, join us on this exciting journey!</p>

<h5 class="h5">By makers - for makers</h5>

<p>Initially, our product will enable makers (DIY enthusiasts) and STEM to</p>

<ul>
    <li>3D-print pet robots.</li>
    <li>Have the robots map the user's home and navigate around the home.</li>
    <li>Endow pet robots with character and skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are offering FREE, open-source (FOSS) software, firmware, hardware, designs for DIY 3D printing, CAD designs, documentation and tutorials for our robots.</p>

    <h5 class="h5">Gods of mods</h5>

<p>Just like with pets, one breed or size or character does not fit all. We get that! That's why our product is a platform, not another social robot. The platform will enable DIY enthusiasts to mod (modify) our off-the-shelf models to craft a multitude of pet robot "breeds" and endow them with a character and skills of their choice.</p>

<p>And, of course, the latest-and-bestest AI technologies including ChatGPT will be duly connected to the platform and available to the pet bots.</p>

<p>Our target customer is everyone who likes pets - and who doesn't. More specifically, there are several potential audiences:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Firstly, there are people who would like to have a pet - for purposes of companionship, security or entertainment - but cannot have a cat or a dog. For example, people like that may not be allowed to have live pets at home. Alternatively, some people are allergic to live pets.</li>
    <li>Other people may not have time or desire or sufficient mobility to care for live pets - including being away from home. Examples of people in this target audience may include seniors, people who live alone - including young people, busy people, people with medical problems.</li>
    <li>Another target audience is early adopters of high-technology products. These people may be of younger age and tech-savvy.</li>
    <li>Yet another target audience is people who would like to impress their friends by owning a novelty product. I think we can help out a bit in this department.</li>
    <li>The DIY robot kit version enables tens of millions of STEM students, makers (Arduino, ESP32, 3D printing) and robotics enthusiasts (ROS/ROS2) to build their own pet robot that is exceptionally affordable, yet remarkably high-tech.</li>
    <li>Last but not least by far are senior citizens in need of companionship and care. "Silver wave" is on its way. Naturally, a pet or companion robot may not replace a human senior living assistant, yet a human assistant can offer more attention and care with the help of robotic aids.</li>
</ul>
