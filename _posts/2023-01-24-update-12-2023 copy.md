## Marketing results
In December we put marketing on a backburner in order to focus on the technology, MVP backlog and making the first product version for sale. Also, this allows us to see the difference that our active marketing efforts add on top of the passive, organic word-of-mouth follower growth.

- 249 YouTube Maker's Pet channel subscribers as of 12/31/2023 vs 170 one month ago
- 161 Reddit [group members](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dPrintedHomeRobots/)
- completed the initial series of build-an-bringup instructions:
  - [Maker's Pet robot Arduino ESP32 breakout board setup instructions](https://youtu.be/zizGI8MjANU)
- published short-format developer log updates and product teasers
  - [Loki robot's laser sensor wobble fix](https://youtu.be/WD62_UqrO44)
  - [Raspberry Pi Pico talks to ESP32 as I2C slave](https://youtube.com/shorts/zUeQN0SpRew)
  - [A hard test to pass - Loki robot drives over thick carpet](https://youtube.com/shorts/wqH1co2c_PE)
  - [$15 LIDAR laser distance scanner connected to Arduino ESP32](https://youtube.com/shorts/gaDnZ4Msw0E)

## Technology and MVP results
- successfully [interfaced](https://youtube.com/shorts/gaDnZ4Msw0E) a $15 laser distance scan sensor to the product's Arduino board (but not yet to ROS2) as proof-of-concept and obtained a live data stream
  - this development is particularly important since it allows us to bring the product cost-of-parts (and possibly the retail price as well) below $99. Making the product widely affordable is one of our key goals.
- added fully-automatic exploration when creating a map (needs debug)
- [tested](https://youtube.com/shorts/wqH1co2c_PE) product with various motor alternatives
- added battery level firmware measurement
- added Raspberry Pi Pico head [extension PCB starter firmware]
  - validated [extension module interface working](https://youtube.com/shorts/zUeQN0SpRew) with the robot's master Arduino ESP PCB
- iterated design of the main [Arduino ESP32 PCB](https://github.com/makerspet/pcb/tree/main/esp32_breakout)
- designed the Raspberry Pi Pico [head extension PCB](https://github.com/makerspet/pcb/tree/main/pico_breakout_head)
- designed the [LDS02RR adapter PCB](https://github.com/makerspet/pcb/tree/main/lds02rr_adapter)
