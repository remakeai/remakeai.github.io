The first pet bot version has been designed in Fusion 360 and printed using a Voron 2.4. Please find the design file(s) here. Why don't we name this pet bot model Snoopy.

The first alpha firmware version is complete, including motor control, 360-degree laser scan capture, WiFi setup.

The code is written using Arduino for ESP32 and makes use and Micro-ROS. Please find the code [here](https://github.com/makerspet/kaiaai_snoopy/tree/main/firmware).

<blockquote>{% include signup-form.html %}</blockquote>

Micro-ROS - with robot-specific extensions - has been packaged into an Arduino library, see code [here](https://github.com/kaiaai/micro_ros_arduino_kaia).

A ROS2 stack - including ROS2 Gazebo simulation - is a work-in-progress, see code [here](https://github.com/kaiaai/kaia).

You can also install the Kaia.ai Docker build [environment](https://hub.docker.com/u/kaiaai) to play with the code.
