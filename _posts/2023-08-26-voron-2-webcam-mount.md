I use this mount for my Voron 2.4. This mount fits many common webcams - specifically, those webcams that have a horizontal tube-like hole in the back.

Here are build instructions and 3MF/STL files. I have included the Autodesk Fusion 360 model.

## Build Instructions

- Print the parts. Use ABS, PETG or ASA that can withstand temperatures higher than PLA in your print chamber.
- Take an M3 screw long enough to span between the two arms; drive it through the left arm into the plastic hole of the right arm.
- Mount the camera by sliding a piece of 1.75mm filament through the mount arms and the webcam's tube-like hole. The webcam's tube-like hole diameter may be larger than the 1.75mm filament by a millimeter or two - and that's ok as long as step 5 succeeds.
- Affix the two extrusion mounts to the 2020 extrusion using M3 screws and extrusion slot nuts of your preference (T-nuts, hammer nuts, roll-in-spring nuts, etc.)
- Tighten the long M3 screw gently. Don't overtighten. The webcam should stay firmly in place - not droop down but be adjustable by hand without straining your fingers.
- Adjust the webcam holder arms angle for best (even) picture.
