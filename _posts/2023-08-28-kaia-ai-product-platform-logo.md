A logo for a consumer robotics software platform...
I personally feel those ubiquitous robot assistant faces adorned with antennae look a bit clich√©.

How about this one? A merry goth anime robo-chick with a WiFi-like emblem for a bow?

Or should we get something else, perhaps with robotic pets? What do you think?
