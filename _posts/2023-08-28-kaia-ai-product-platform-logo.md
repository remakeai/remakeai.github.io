A logo for a consumer robotics software platform...
I personally feel those ubiquitous robot assistant faces adorned with antennae look a bit clich√©.

How about this one as a logo and a mascot?
A merry, classy, elegant, fashionable, chic anime onna-no-ko robot with a WiFi-like emblem for a bow?

Or should we get something else, perhaps a robotic pet? What do you think?
