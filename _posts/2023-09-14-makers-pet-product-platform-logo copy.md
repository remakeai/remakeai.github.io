A logo for a consumer robotics hardware platform...
As I have mentioned in this [post](/blog/kaia-ai-product-platform-logo/),
I personally feel those ubiquitous robot assistant faces adorned with antennae look
a bit clich√©.

How about this one? A merry anime Shibu Inu dog with a WiFi-like emblem for a bow - an element
that carries over from our [Kaia.ai logo](/blog/kaia-ai-product-platform-logo/)?

Or should we get something else, perhaps with robotic pets? What do you think?

Anyway, please visit our [Maker's Pet](https://makerspet.ai) website for updates on
3D-printable DIY home robot models and hardware tutorials including 3D printing,
3D CAD design and electronics!
