If this looks like a monthly status report, well, it is - for you! Please follow us if
tech startups are your thing! If you are a potential business partner -
or a potential competitor, including 中国大陆, 中國大陸 robotics manufacturers -
drop me an email!

- September kicked off marketing activities as our audience - adults, STEM highschoolers and their parents
(including yours truly parent) - came back from the typical summer time off.
  - We have set up a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/243730868651472/).
  As of 6:25pm PST 9/26/2023, the group counts 131 members (Thank you, thank you for joining!).
  Is this a little or is this a lot?
  - We have set up a [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dPrintedHomeRobots/).
  - Our mailing list is at 188. Have you joined?
  - Our flagship (for now) DIY home robot Snoopy got its post at
  [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.com/2023/09/21/3d-printed-robot-wants-to-be-your-pet/)
  (thank you, Richard Baguley at Hackaday!)
  - Snoopy also got featured at [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/3D-printable-Arduino-Pet-Robot/)
  - We got interest from early-stage venture capital. I appreciate you reaching out to us.
  - Did you know that Snoopy's BoM (bill-of-material) in its minimal configuration
  [rings up to a $200 total](https://makerspet.com/blog/snoopy-bill-of-materials/)? Let me rephrase it -
  a Amazon Astro $1599 class home robot - assembled DIY - at $200. How we have managed such a feat?
  - We decided to add a 200mm (and a 250mm) robot versions to the product lineup. This is because
  most 3D printers out there are not big enough to print Snoopy. There will be a change in the flaghip product.
- Technology-execution-wise, we have set up and run a slew of 3D VR-style robot simulations. Simulation may
not seem important this very moment, but they do generate a veritable tons of marketing material and
help test and debug the real robot. The simulations will become important a bit later.
  - We have set up a 3D VR-style [living room simulation](https://kaia.ai/blog/living-room-simulation/).
  Check out the picture on the TV displaying the Maldives - so relaxing!
  - In this first-of-a-kind (manually-driven for now) simulation Snoopy shows off its playfullness and
  wholesome pet-ness by [playing ball and hiding under a table](https://kaia.ai/blog/snoopy-hides-plays-ball-in-simulation/).
  Here is the full step-by-step follow-along [tutorial](https://kaia.ai/blog/gazebo-3d-simulation-tutorial/)
  for makers and STEM students. NB, sorry, no sound until we set up a DIY recording studio.
  - Snoopy [maps, navigates](https://kaia.ai/blog/snoopy-hides-plays-ball-in-simulation/)
  a 3D virtual living room - automatically - in these TikTok-style clips as well as the
  [step-by-step follow-along tutorial](https://kaia.ai/blog/gazebo-mapping-navigation-tutorial/).
  - We have moved our three websites ([makerspet.com](https://kaia.ai) for DIY hardware -
  [kaia.ai](https://kaia.ai) for software developers and [remake.ai](https://remake.ai) startup business -
  to a fast, globally available platform for a professional look and feel.
  - Last but not the least, the physical robot bring-up is underway. I hope we will publish videos of the real physical
  robot in action by the end of this week.
