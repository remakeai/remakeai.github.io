Please follow us if tech startups are your thing!

## Marketing results
In January we continued focusing on the technology implementation - in particular on adding support to a large number of low-cost laser distance sensors. This step is necessary both to bring down the cost of the robot parts kit and, later, to evaluate and select the best performing LiDAR/LDS sensor models. We expect that publishing these results will also bring us some publicity and raise the brand recognition in the robot maker communities.

- Our [pre-launch mailing list](http://eepurl.com/gBV7tb) growth has markedly accelerated to ~10% monthly signups, without any active promotion on our part.
- We've published two more short-format developer log updates:
  - [Update: $15 LIDAR laser distance scanner connected to Arduino ESP32 and ROS2](https://youtube.com/shorts/STbCVhdgLSw)
  - [DIY PCB connects Arduino to Xiaomi LDS02RR LiDAR](https://youtube.com/shorts/Wes9GYomUdE)
- New blog posts:
  - [$15 LiDAR sensor is now supported!](https://makerspet.com/blog/xiaomi-lds02rr-lidar-support/)
  - [Arduino ESP32 ROS2 robot platform firmware available](https://kaia.ai/blog/arduino-platform-firmware-avaiable/)

## Technology and MVP results
- We have successfully interfaced these LDS sensors:
  - [YDLIDAR X3 PRO](https://youtube.com/shorts/_VuRCiO55gA)
  - YDLIDAR X2/X2L
  - [Neato XV11](https://youtube.com/shorts/kfk1Q0RSJpI)
- The LDS02RR PCB adapter was successfully [brought up](https://youtube.com/shorts/STbCVhdgLSw)
- We've added [PCB adapter](https://github.com/makerspet/pcb/tree/main/neato_delta_adapter) support for 3irobotix Delta-2G LDS.
- We have reorganized disparate robot firmware into the single, "platform", configurable version. This is an important step for making Kaia.ai a software platform.
  - As part of the platform merge, we have implemented [robot configuration](https://kaia.ai/blog/arduino-platform-firmware-avaiable/) - using a web browser - to select the robot's LiDAR/LDS type, robot and motor models.
- Miscellaneous technical progress
  - The robot's MCU "factory reset" feature has been redone to satisfaction
  - We've brought all PCB designs into a [single PCB repository](https://github.com/makerspet/pcb) to simplify and streamline the source code access and the release process.
