I've submitted an [application](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98607354) to register the Maker's Pet logo and name as a trademark.

The trademark application has become necessary and urgent since we've started our Kickstarter product launch preparations for [Maker's Pet Mini](https://makerspet.com/blog/kickstarter-launch-mini/).

Also, we have started setting up Maker's Pet [online store](https://makerspet.com/store). It is best to have the brand trademark in place when selling begins.
