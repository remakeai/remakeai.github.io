I've registered the Maker's Pet logo and name as a [trademark application with USPTO](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98607354).

The trademark registration has become necessary and urgent since we've started our Kickstarter product launch preparations for [Maker's Pet Mini](https://makerspet.com/blog/kickstarter-launch-mini/).

Also, we have started setting up Maker's Pet online store and it's best to have the trademark in place when selling.
